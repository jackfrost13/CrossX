The caves consist of 36 identifiable foundations, some of them discovered after 
the original numbering of the caves from 1 through 29. The later identified 
caves have been suffixed with the letters of the alphabet, such as 15A, identified 
between originally numbered caves 15 and 16. The cave-numbering is a 
convention of convenience, and has nothing to do with chronological order of their construction.
