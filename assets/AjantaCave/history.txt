According to UNESCO, these are masterpieces of Buddhist religious art that influenced 
the Indian art that followed. The caves were built in two phases, the first phase 
starting around the 2nd century BCE, while the second phase was built around 400–650 CE,
according to older accounts, or in a brief period of 460–480 CE according to later scholarship. 
The site is a protected monument in the care of the Archaeological Survey of India, and 
since 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
