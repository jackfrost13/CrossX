Basing his arguments on the excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India
 (ASI) in 1999-2000 at the Chabeli Tila, senior Agra journalist Bhanu Pratap 
Singh said the antique pieces, statues, and structures all point to a lost 
"culture and religious site," more than 1,000 years ago. "The excavations 
yielded a rich crop of Jain statues, hundreds of them, including the foundation 
stone of a temple with the date. The statues were a thousand years 
old of Bhagwan Adi Nath, Bhagwan Rishabh Nath, Bhagwan Mahavir and 
Jain Yakshinis," said Swarup Chandra Jain, senior leader of the Jain 
community. Historian Sugam Anand states that there is proof of habitation, 
temples and commercial centres before Akbar established it 
as his capital. He states that the open space on a ridge was used 
by Akbar to build his capital.
