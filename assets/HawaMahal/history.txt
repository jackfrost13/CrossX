The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh. He was 
so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and 
historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its unique five-story exterior 
is akin to the honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 small windows called jharokhas 
decorated with intricate latticework. The original intent of the lattice design 
was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the 
street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah", 
which forbade them from appearing in public without face coverings.
