The old Nizamat Imambara was built by Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah 
in the Nizamat Fort Area. He bought bricks and mortar, and laid the 
foundation of the building with his own hands. However, the old 
Imambara was primarily made up of wood. The plot where this Imambara 
had been built was dug to a depth of 6 feet. It was refilled with soil which was 
brought from Mecca so that the poor members of the Muslim community 
could have an experience of Hajj.
