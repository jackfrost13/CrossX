India Gate is a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army 
who died in the period 1914â€“21 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, 
Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the 
Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including 
some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate. 
The India Gate, even though a war memorial, evokes the architectural style of 
the triumphal arch like the Arch of Constantine, outside the Colosseum in Rome, 
and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India 
in Mumbai. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.
