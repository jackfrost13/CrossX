'''The Indian Museum originated from the Asiatic Society of Bengal
which was created by Sir William Jones in 1784. The concept of having 
a museum arose in 1796 from members of the Asiatic Society as a 
place where man-made and natural objects could be collected, cared for 
and displayed. The objective began to look achievable in 1808 when the 
Society was offered suitable accommodation by the Government of India 
in the Chowringhee-Park Street area.'''
