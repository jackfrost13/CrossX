'''During World War I, British India contributed to the British war effort
by providing men and resources. Millions of Indian soldiers and labourers 
served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian 
administration and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and 
ammunition. However, Bengal and Punjab remained sources of anticolonial activities. 
Revolutionary attacks in Bengal, associated increasingly with disturbances 
in Punjab, were significant enough to nearly paralyse the regional 
administration. Of these, a pan-Indian mutiny in the British Indian 
Army planned for February 1915 was the most prominent amongst 
a number of plots formulated between 1914 and 1917 
by Indian nationalists in India, the United States and Germany.'''
