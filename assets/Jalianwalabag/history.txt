'''The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, took place
on 13 April 1919 when troops of the British Indian Army under the 
command of Colonel Reginald Dyer fired rifles into a crowd of Punjabis, 
who had gathered in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab. The Rowlatt Act, 
1919 had been implemented, but the civilians were not informed. The 
civilians had assembled for a festival known as Baisakhi. Baisakhi marks 
the Sikh new year and commemorates the formation of Khalsa panth of 
warriors under Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. It is additionally a spring harvest 
festival for the Sikhs. It is also stated that it marks peaceful protest to 
condemn the arrest and deportation of two national leaders, Satya Pal and 
Saifuddin Kitchlew. Raja Ram has argued, however, that the Proclamation 
was ineffective, the crowd formed in deliberate defiance and 
the event signals a beginning of Indian nationalism.'''
