'''In 1559, Mukunda Gajapati came to throne in Cuttack. He aligned himself as
an ally of Akbar and an enemy of the Sultan of Bengal, Sulaiman Khan Karrani. After 
a few battles, Odisha finally fell. The fall was also aided by the internal turmoil of 
the state. In 1568, the Konark temple was damaged by the army of Kalapahad, 
a general of the Sultan. Kalapahad is also said to be responsible for damages 
to several other temples during the conquest. '''
