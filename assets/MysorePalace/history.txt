'''The last palace, now known as the Old Palace or the Wooden Palace,
was burnt into ashes during the 1896 Dasara festivities. Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar 
IV and his mother Maharani Kempananjammanni Devi, commissioned the British 
architect Lord Henry Irwin to build a new palace. Meanwhile, the royal family stayed 
in the closeby Jaganmohan Palace. The construction was overseen by B. P. Raghavulu Naidu, 
an executive engineer in the Mysore Palace division. He had conducted 
elaborate architectural studies during visits to Delhi, Madras, and Calcutta, 
and these were used in planning for the new palace. The construction cost was 
placed at Rs 41,47,913 (around $30 million adjusted to inflation) and was completed in 1912.'''
