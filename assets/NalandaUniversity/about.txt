'''Nalanda University (also known as Nalanda International University) is an international university located in Rajgir,
near Nalanda, India, which was established by an Act of Parliament to emulate the famous Nalanda University of ancient India. 
The original university functioned for 800 years from around 400 AD, long before Oxford, Cambridge or Harvard came into 
existence. Nalanda University at its peak housed 10,000 students from all across Asia. Some famous personalities 
associated with the original university include Lord Buddha, who preached at Rajgir centuries earlier. The university 
began its first academic session on September 1, 2014 with 15 students including five women. Initially set up with 
temporary facilities in Rajgir, a massive modern campus is expected to be finished by 2020. The university has been designated 
as an "international university of national importance." Nalanda is exclusively a graduate school, currently only 
offering Master's courses, with PhD programmes to be offered in future'''
