'''The history of the National Library began with the formation of the
Calcutta Public Library in 1836. That was a non-governmental institution 
and was run on a proprietary basis. People contributing ₹300 (US$4.20) 
in subscription became the proprietors. Prince Dwarkanath Tagore 
was the first proprietor of that Library. ₹ 300 at that time was a significant 
amount, so poor students and others were allowed free use of the library 
for some period of time. Lord Metcalfe, the Governor General at that
time, transferred 4,675 volumes from the library of the College of Fort William, 
Kolkata to the Calcutta Public Library. This and donations of books from 
individuals formed the nucleus of the library. Both Indian and foreign books, 
especially British, were purchased for the library. Donations were regularly 
made by individuals as well as by the government. The Calcutta Public Library 
had a unique position as the first public library in this part of the world. Such a 
well-organized and efficiently run library was rare even in Europe during the first 
half of the 19th century. '''
