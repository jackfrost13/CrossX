The roots of the National Museum begin with an exhibition of Indian art and 
artefacts at the Royal Academy in London in the winter of 1947-48. At the end of the 
London exhibition, the exhibition curators had decided to display the same collection 
intact in India before returning the artefacts to their individual museums. The Indian 
exhibition was shown at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in 1949, and was so successful that it 
led to the decision to form a permanent National Museum. On 15 August 1949, the 
National Museum was formally inaugurated by the then Governor-General of India, 
Chakravarti Rajagopalachari. At that time, it was decided that until a permanent home 
could be found for the collection, it would continue to be housed at the 
Rashtrapati Bhawan. The cornerstone of the present museum building was laid 
by Jawaharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister of India, on 12 May 1955, and the 
building formally opened to the public on 18 December 1960. Today, the museum 
is administered and funded by the Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Tourism.
