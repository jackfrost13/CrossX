'''Qutab Minar was established along with Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque
around 1192 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak, first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. 
The mosque complex is one of the earliest that survives in the 
Indian subcontinent. The minaret is named after Qutab-ud-din Aibak, 
or Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, a Sufi saint. Its ground storey was built 
over the ruins of the Lal Kot, the citadel of Dhillika. Aibak's successor 
Iltutmish added three more storeys. The minar's topmost storey was 
damaged by lightning in 1369 and was rebuilt by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, 
who added another storey. In 1505, an earthquake damaged Qutub Minar'''
