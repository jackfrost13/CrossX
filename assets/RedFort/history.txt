'''Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on
12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. 
Originally red and white, the Shah's favourite colours, its design is 
credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahouri, who also constructed the 
Taj Mahal. The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which fed the moats 
surrounding most of the walls. Construction began in the sacred month 
of Muharram, on 13 May 1638. Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was 
completed on 6 April 1648. Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort's 
boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh Fort. 
The fortress-palace was a focal point of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad, 
which is present-day Old Delhi. Its planning and aesthetics represent 
the zenith of Mughal creativity prevailing during Shah Jahan's reign. His 
successor Aurangzeb added the Pearl Mosque to the emperor's private 
quarters, constructing barbicans in front of the two main gates to make the 
entrance to the palace more circuitous.'''
