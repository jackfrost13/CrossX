Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 
1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 
10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed 
in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 
32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion 
rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 
artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by 
the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri
