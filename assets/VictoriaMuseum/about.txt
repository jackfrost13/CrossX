The Victoria Memorial's architect was William Emerson (1843â€“1924), 
president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. 
The design is in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style which uses a 
mixture of British and Mughal elements with Venetian, Egyptian, 
Deccani and Islamic architectural influences. The building is 338 feet
(103 m) by 228 feet(69 m) and rises to a height of 184 feet(56 m). 
It is constructed of white Makrana marble. The gardens of the Victoria 
Memorial were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain. Emerson's assistant, Vincent Jerome Esch, 
designed the bridge of the north aspect and the garden gates.
