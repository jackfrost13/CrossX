In January 1901, on the death of Queen Victoria. The 1st Baron Curzon of Kedleston (later created The 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston), 
the then Viceroy of India, suggested the creation of a fitting memorial. Lord Curzon proposed the construction 
of a grand building with a museum and gardens. Curzon said, "Let us, therefore, have a building, stately, spacious, monumental 
and grand, to which every newcomer in Calcutta will turn, to which all the resident population, European and Native, will flock, 
where all classes will learn the lessons of history, and see revived before their eyes the marvels of the past."
The Prince of Wales, later King George V, laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906, and it was formally opened to the public in 1921.
In 1912, before the construction of the Victoria Memorial was finished, King George V announced the transfer of the capital 
of India from Calcutta to New Delhi. Thus, the Victoria Memorial was built in what would be a provincial city rather than a capital.
