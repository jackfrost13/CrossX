by providing men and resources. Millions of Indian soldiers and labourers

administration and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and 
ammunition. However, Bengal and Punjab remained sources of anticolonial activities.

in Punjab, were significant enough to nearly paralyse the regional 
administration. Of these, a pan-Indian mutiny in the British Indian

Originally red and white, the Shah's favourite colours, its design is

Taj Mahal. The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which fed the moats 
surrounding most of the walls. Construction began in the sacred month

boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh Fort. 
The fortress-palace was a focal point of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad, 
which is present-day Old Delhi. Its planning and aesthetics represent 
the zenith of Mughal creativity prevailing during Shah Jahan's reign. His 
successor Aurangzeb added the Pearl Mosque to the emperor's private 
quarters, constructing barbicans in front of the two main gates to make the 
entrance to the palace more circuitous.'''),
